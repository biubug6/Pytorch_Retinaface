# Modify

  this repo main difference from original is add negative data train

  you can now add some image path without any annotions in you label.txt,then it can train now!

# RetinaFace in PyTorch

A [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) implementation of [RetinaFace: Single-stage Dense Face Localisation in the Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00641). Model size only 1.7M, when Retinaface use mobilenet0.25 as backbone net. We also provide resnet50 as backbone net to get better result. The official code in Mxnet can be found [here](https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface/tree/master/RetinaFace).

## Mobile or Edge device deploy
We also provide a set of Face Detector for edge device in [here](https://github.com/biubug6/Face-Detector-1MB-with-landmark) from python training to C++ inference.

## WiderFace Val Performance in single scale When using Resnet50 as backbone net.
| Style | easy | medium | hard |
|:-|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Pytorch (same parameter with Mxnet) | 94.82 % | 93.84% | 89.60% |
| Pytorch (original image scale) | 95.48% | 94.04% | 84.43% |
| Mxnet | 94.86% | 93.87% | 88.33% |
| Mxnet(original image scale) | 94.97% | 93.89% | 82.27% |

## WiderFace Val Performance in single scale When using Mobilenet0.25 as backbone net.
| Style | easy | medium | hard |
|:-|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Pytorch (same parameter with Mxnet) | 88.67% | 87.09% | 80.99% |
| Pytorch (original image scale) | 90.70% | 88.16% | 73.82% |
| Mxnet | 88.72% | 86.97% | 79.19% |
| Mxnet(original image scale) | 89.58% | 87.11% | 69.12% |

## Installation
##### Clone and install
1. git clone https://github.com/biubug6/Pytorch_Retinaface.git

2. Pytorch version 1.1.0+ and torchvision 0.3.0+ are needed.

3. Codes are based on Python 3

##### Data
1. Download the [WIDERFACE](http://shuoyang1213.me/WIDERFACE/WiderFace_Results.html) dataset.

2. Download annotations (face bounding boxes & five facial landmarks) from [baidu cloud](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1Laby0EctfuJGgGMgRRgykA) or [dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7j70r3eeepe4r2g/retinaface_gt_v1.1.zip?dl=0)

3. Organise the dataset directory as follows:

```Shell
  ./data/widerface/
    train/
      images/
      label.txt
    val/
      images/
      wider_val.txt
```
ps: wider_val.txt only include val file names but not label information.

##### Data1
We also provide the organized dataset we used as in the above directory structure.

Link: from [google cloud](https://drive.google.com/open?id=11UGV3nbVv1x9IC--_tK3Uxf7hA6rlbsS) or [baidu cloud](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1jIp9t30oYivrAvrgUgIoLQ) Password: ruck

## Training
We provide restnet50 and mobilenet0.25 as backbone network to train model.
We trained Mobilenet0.25 on imagenet dataset and get 46.58%  in top 1. If you do not wish to train the model, we also provide trained model. Pretrain model  and trained model are put in [google cloud](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1oZRSG0ZegbVkVwUd8wUIQx8W7yfZ_ki1) and [baidu cloud](https://pan.baidu.com/s/12h97Fy1RYuqMMIV-RpzdPg) Password: fstq . The model could be put as follows:
```Shell
  ./weights/
      mobilenet0.25_Final.pth
      mobilenetV1X0.25_pretrain.tar
      Resnet50_Final.pth
```
1. Before training, you can check network configuration (e.g. batch_size, min_sizes and steps etc..) in ``data/config.py and train.py``.

2. Train the model using WIDER FACE:
  ```Shell
  CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3 python train.py --network resnet50 or
  CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python train.py --network mobile0.25
  ```


## Evaluation
### Evaluation widerface val
1. Generate txt file
```Shell
python test_widerface.py --trained_model weight_file --network mobile0.25 or resnet50
```
2. Evaluate txt results. Demo come from [Here](https://github.com/wondervictor/WiderFace-Evaluation)
```Shell
cd ./widerface_evaluate
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
python evaluation.py
```
3. You can also use widerface official Matlab evaluate demo in [Here](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/WIDERFace/WiderFace_Results.html)
### Evaluation FDDB

1. Download the images [FDDB](https://drive.google.com/open?id=17t4WULUDgZgiSy5kpCax4aooyPaz3GQH) to:
```Shell
./data/FDDB/images/
```

2. Evaluate the trained model using:
```Shell
python test_fddb.py --trained_model weight_file --network mobile0.25 or resnet50
```

3. Download [eval_tool](https://bitbucket.org/marcopede/face-eval) to evaluate the performance.
